### Practical Exercise: Introduction to Cyberattacks using WebGoat

## What is WebGoat?

WebGoat is an educational platform created by OWASP that allows developers and security enthusiasts to test vulnerabilities commonly found in web applications. It serves as a hands-on training environment where users can learn how to exploit common vulnerabilities in a safe and controlled manner.

## Instructions for Setting Up WebGoat on a Raspberry Pi

### Step 1: Update and Upgrade Your Raspberry Pi
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install Java
WebGoat requires Java to run. You can install OpenJDK 11 with the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```
Verify the installation:
```bash
java -version
```
You should see output that confirms Java is installed.

### Step 3: Download WebGoat
Download the latest WebGoat JAR file from the [official WebGoat GitHub releases page](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases) or use `wget` to download it directly. Be sure if you use the wget script to replace XX.XX with the proper release version!:
```bash
wget https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases/download/vXX.XX/webgoat-server-XX.XX.jar
```
** Replace `XX.XX` with the current version number. **

Move the JAR file to a directory of your choice:
```bash
mkdir ~/webgoat
mv webgoat-server-XX.XX.jar ~/webgoat
```

### Step 4: Run WebGoat
Navigate to the WebGoat directory:
```bash
cd ~/webgoat
```
Run WebGoat:
```bash
java -jar webgoat-server-XX.XX.jar
```
WebGoat will start on port 8080 by default.
** Replace `XX.XX` with the current version number. **

### Step 5: Access WebGoat
Open a browser and go to:
```text
http://localhost:8080/WebGoat
```
Or use the Raspberry Pi's IP address if accessing from another device.

## Exercise: SQL Injection

In the WebGoat navigation panel, select "injection" and perform the lab exercise "SQL Injection (intro)**

## Optional:

If you get done with SQL Injection early and/or are already familiar with it, feel free to select another attack to experiment with.
