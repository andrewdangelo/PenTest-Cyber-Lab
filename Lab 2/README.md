### Practical Exercise: Introduction to White Hat Hacking on Raspberry Pi

#### Objective
To learn basic white hat hacking principles using a Raspberry Pi, including network scanning, vulnerability assessment, exploitation using ethical hacking tools, keylogger attacks, and ARP spoofing.

#### Materials Needed
- Raspberry Pi (Model 3 or 4 recommended)
- MicroSD card (16GB or larger) with Raspbian OS installed
- Power supply for Raspberry Pi
- HDMI cable and monitor (or a laptop with VNC viewer for remote access)
- Keyboard and mouse
- Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi dongle (if not using built-in Wi-Fi)

#### Introduction to White Hat Hacking

White hat hacking, or ethical hacking, involves using hacking techniques for legal and ethical purposes, such as identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in systems. White hat hackers use their skills to improve security and protect against malicious attacks.

#### Installing Essential Tools

1. **Update the package list and install essential tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nmap netcat metasploit-framework dsniff
   ```
2. ** Start Metasploit Framework **
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   msfdb init
   msfconsole
   ```

   This command starts the PostgreSQL service, initializes the Metasploit database, and opens the Metasploit console.

### Basic Network Scanning with Nmap
Review of Nmap: Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It can identify live hosts, open ports, running services, and more.

1. Scanning the Local Raspberry Pi: 
   Perform a ping scan to check if the local machine is up.

   ```bash
      nmap -sn 127.0.0.1
   ```
2. Scan open ports- This command scans all ports on the local Raspberry Pi.
   ```bash
      nmap -p 1-65535 127.0.0.1
   ```

The output will show which ports are open and which services are running on those ports.

### Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability assessment involves identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in a system. You will use Nmap and Metasploit for this purpose.

## Steps:
1. ** Use Nmap Scripts for Vulnerability Assessment: **
   Nmap includes scripts that can check for various vulnerabilities on a target system.

   ```bash
      nmap --script vuln 127.0.0.1
   ```

   The output will list potential vulnerabilities on the Raspberry Pi.

2. **Use Metasploit for Vulnerability Assessment: **
   Metasploit has many auxiliary modules that can be used to scan for vulnerabilities.

   - Start Metasploit:
      ``` bash
         mfsconsole
      ```
   - Search for vulnerability scanners:
      ``` bash
         search type:auxiliary scanner
      ```
   - Use a specific scanner:
      ``` bash
         use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version
         set RHOSTS 127.0.0.1
         run
      ```

      This example scans the local Raspberry Pi to identify the HTTP version running on the server.
